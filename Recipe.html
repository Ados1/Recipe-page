      <div id="Parag">
        <h4 class="he4">STEP 1</h4>
        <p>
          Wash the tomatoes and peppers. Remove the stalk from the peppers. Peel
          the onions and garlic cloves. Wash the rice under a cold tap until the
          water runs clear, and drain in a colander.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cut one onion into quarters and add into a blender. Add the tomatoes,
          red bell pepper, scotch bonnet pepper, garlic and ginger, then add
          half a cup of water and liquidize until smooth. Keep aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chop the remaining onion. Heat the oil in a pan under medium heat,
          then pour the chopped onions. Cook util the onions start to brown.
        </p>

        <h4 class="he4">STEP 2</h4>
        <p>
          Add the tomato paste and reduce the heat.Use a wooden spoon to stir
          while it fries for 5 mins. Raise the heat to medium .Pour two cups of
          the blended peppers mix into the pan. Add the curry powder, nutmeg,
          and bay leaves, then sprinkle in the stock cubes. Mix well with a
          wooden spoon and allow to cook while stirring occasionally. Cook until
          the moisture has reduced significantly and the oil has settled on the
          surface. This will take at least 20 mins.
        </p>

        <p>
          Add the chicken stock and mix the rice into the pan. Then add 1 cup of
          water, taste for salt and add more if needed. Allow the rice to come
          to a boil, then reduce the heat. Place a sheet of aluminium foil over
          the rice, then cover the pan.
        </p>

        <p>
          Check after 10 mins and stir the rice with awooden spoon. Repeat a
          more frequently, until the rice is cooked through and has absorbed all
          the sauce for atleast 30 mins. Remove from heat, stir with a wooden
          spoon, put the lid back on and leave for a few minutes before serving.
          Food is ready to be served.
